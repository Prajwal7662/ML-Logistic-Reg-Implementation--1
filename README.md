Logistic Regression Implementation 🧠📊
📌 Overview

This repository demonstrates the implementation of Logistic Regression — one of the fundamental algorithms in Machine Learning used for binary classification problems. Logistic Regression is widely used in applications such as spam detection, medical diagnosis, and customer churn prediction.

The model works by applying the logistic (sigmoid) function to map predicted values to probabilities between 0 and 1, making it suitable for classification tasks.

🚀 Key Concepts

Logistic Function (Sigmoid): Converts linear outputs into probabilities.

Decision Boundary: Threshold (usually 0.5) to classify outcomes.

Cost Function: Uses Log Loss (Cross-Entropy Loss) to measure error.

Gradient Descent: Optimizes model parameters.

Evaluation Metrics: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score, ROC-AUC.

🛠️ Implementation Steps

Import Libraries – NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Scikit-learn.

Load Dataset – Use any binary classification dataset (e.g., Titanic, Breast Cancer, Custom CSV).

Preprocess Data – Handle missing values, normalization, and train-test split.

Train Model – Apply Logistic Regression using Scikit-learn.

Make Predictions – Predict class probabilities and labels.

Evaluate Model – Calculate accuracy, confusion matrix, ROC curve, etc.

Visualize Results – Plot decision boundary and performance metrics.
